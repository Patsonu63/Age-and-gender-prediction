We will use the Age, Gender (Face Data) CSV dataset for our purpose and to achieve this we will use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). CNN is a powerful tool in Deep Learning that helps the user classify an Image and has the most usage in Computer Vision. It enables the Machine to visualize and interpret Images and Image data. For an in-depth explanation of CNN and its architecture.
